# Search Unicode

Search Unicode is an Alfred 5 Workflow to lookup and reverse lookup Unicode characters and emoji with their names.

## Download

Download it at the [release page](https://github.com/blueset/alfred-search-unicode/releases).

You need to install Python 3 on your macOS in order for this to work.
You can install that with [Homebrew] using the command below:

```sh
brew install python
```

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

  <summary>Seeing ‚Äú‚Äòuni‚Äô cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified‚Äù?</summary>
  
  It can be resolved by:

  1. Open _Alfred Preferences > Workflows_ section
  1. Right-click `Search Unicode` > `Open in Finder`
  1. Right-click the `uni-arm64` executable and choose `Open`.
  1. If you see a `‚ö†Ô∏è "uni-arm64" Not Opened` dialog, click `Done`
  1. Open System Settings, and click `Privacy & Security` (blue square with hand icon).
  1. Scroll to the bottom of the Privacy & Security pane, and look for the message `"uni-amd64" was blocked to protect your Mac.` Click `Open Anyway`
  1. Terminal.app should open and display `uni`'s default help options. You can close Terminal, the Workflow should now be allowed to run.
