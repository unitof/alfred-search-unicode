# Search Unicode

Search Unicode is an Alfred 5 Workflow to lookup and reverse lookup Unicode characters and emoji with their names.

## Download

Download it at the [release page](https://github.com/blueset/alfred-search-unicode/releases).

You need to install Python 3 on your macOS in order for this to work.
You can install that with [Homebrew] using the command below:

```sh
brew install python
```

[Homebrew]: https://brew.sh/

  <summary>Seeing “‘uni’ cannot be opened because the developer cannot be verified”?</summary>
  
  It can be resolved by:

  1. Open _Alfred Preferences > Workflows_ section
  1. Right-click `Search Unicode` > `Open in Finder`
  1. Right-click the `uni-arm64` executable and choose `Open`.
  1. If you see a `⚠️ "uni-arm64" Not Opened` dialog, click `Done`
  1. Open System Settings, and click `Privacy & Security` (blue square with hand icon).
  1. Scroll to the bottom of the Privacy & Security pane, and look for the message `"uni-amd64" was blocked to protect your Mac.` Click `Open Anyway`
  1. Terminal.app should open and display `uni`'s default help options. You can close Terminal, the Workflow should now be allowed to run.

matching the keyword.

- Press <kbd>Cmd</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy its Hex code to clipboard (ex. `U+2070`)
- Press <kbd>Option</kbd> + <kbd>Return</kbd> to copy its name to clipboard (ex. `Superscript Zero`)

### Search character by code point

![Screenshot for command u fffd ff10](images/u_fffd_ff10.png)

Type `u codepoint [[codepoint] ...]` (ex. `u fffd ff10`) to look up characters by its codepoint.

The same 3 options apply here too.
